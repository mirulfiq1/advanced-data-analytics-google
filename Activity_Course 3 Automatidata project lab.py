# # **Course 3 Automatidata project**
# **Course 3 - Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights**

# You are the newest data professional in a fictional data consulting firm: Automatidata. The team is still early into the project, having only just completed an initial plan of action and some early Python coding work. 
# 
# Luana Rodriquez, the senior data analyst at Automatidata, is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with some EDA and data visualization work for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission project (New York City TLC) to get a general understanding of what taxi ridership looks like. The management team is asking for a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data. At the very least, include a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month. 
# 
# Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. For this taxi data, create a Tableau dashboard showing a New York City map of taxi/limo trips by month. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isn’t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director at the New York City TLC is a person with visual impairments.
# 
# A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

# # Course 3 End-of-course project: Exploratory data analysis
# 
# In this activity, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. You will also design a professional data visualization that tells a story, and will help data-driven decisions for business needs. 
# 
# Please note that the Tableau visualization activity is optional, and will not affect your completion of the course. Completing the Tableau activity will help you practice planning out and plotting a data visualization based on a specific business need. The structure of this activity is designed to emulate the proposals you will likely be assigned in your career as a data professional. Completing this activity will help prepare you for those career moments.
# 
# **The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. Your mission is to continue the investigation you began in C2 and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables. 
#   
# **The goal** is to clean data set and create a visualization.
# <br/>  
# *This activity has 4 parts:*
# 
# **Part 1:** Imports, links, and loading
# 
# **Part 2:** Data Exploration
# *   Data cleaning
# 
# 
# **Part 3:** Building visualizations
# 
# **Part 4:** Evaluate and share results
# 
# <br/> 
# Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.
# 
# Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

# Throughout these project notebooks, you'll see references to the problem-solving framework PACE. The following notebook components are labeled with the respective PACE stage: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute.

# <img src="images/Plan.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>
# 
# 
# ## PACE: Plan 
# 
# In this stage, consider the following questions where applicable to complete your code response:
# 1. Identify any outliers: 
# 
# 
# *   What methods are best for identifying outliers?
# *   How do you make the decision to keep or exclude outliers from any future models?
# 
# 

# ==> ENTER YOUR RESPONSE HERE

# ### Task 1. Imports, links, and loading
# Go to Tableau Public
# The following link will help you complete this activity. Keep Tableau Public open as you proceed to the next steps. 
# 
# Link to supporting materials: 
# Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/s/ 
# 
# For EDA of the data, import the data and packages that would be most helpful, such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib. 
# 

# In[12]:


# Import packages and libraries
#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import datetime as dt
import seaborn as sns 


# **Note:** As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.

# In[2]:


# Load dataset into dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv')


# <img src="images/Analyze.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>
# 
# ## PACE: Analyze 
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Analyze stage.

# ### Task 2a. Data exploration and cleaning
# 
# Decide which columns are applicable
# 
# The first step is to assess your data. Check the Data Source page on Tableau Public to get a sense of the size, shape and makeup of the data set. Then answer these questions to yourself: 
# 
# Given our scenario, which data columns are most applicable? 
# Which data columns can I eliminate, knowing they won’t solve our problem scenario? 
# 
# Consider functions that help you understand and structure the data. 
# 
# *    head()
# *    describe()
# *    info()
# *    groupby()
# *    sortby()
# 
# What do you do about missing data (if any)? 
# 
# Are there data outliers? What are they and how might you handle them? 
# 
# What do the distributions of your variables tell you about the question you're asking or the problem you're trying to solve?
# 
# 
# 

# ==> ENTER YOUR RESPONSE HERE

# Start by discovering, using head and size. 

# In[3]:


#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df.head()


# In[9]:


#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
meow = df['VendorID'].size
meow


# Use describe... 

# In[6]:


#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df.describe()


# And info. 

# In[7]:


#==> ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
df.info()


# ### Task 2b. Assess whether dimensions and measures are correct

# On the data source page in Tableau, double check the data types for the applicable columns you selected on the previous step. Pay close attention to the dimensions and measures to assure they are correct. 
# 
# In Python, consider the data types of the columns. *Consider:* Do they make sense? 

# Review the link provided in the previous activity instructions to create the required Tableau visualization. 

# ### Task 2c. Select visualization type(s)

# Select data visualization types that will help you understand and explain the data.
# 
# Now that you know which data columns you’ll use, it is time to decide which data visualization makes the most sense for EDA of the TLC dataset. What type of data visualization(s) would be most helpful? 
# 
# * Line graph
# * Bar chart
# * Box plot
# * Histogram
# * Heat map
# * Scatter plot
# * A geographic map

# ## PACE: Construct 
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Construct stage.

# ### Task 3. Data visualization
# 
# You’ve assessed your data, and decided on which data variables are most applicable. It’s time to plot your visualization(s)!
# 

# ### Boxplots

# Perform a check for outliers on relevant columns such as trip distance and trip duration. Remember, some of the best ways to identify the presence of outliers in data are box plots and histograms.

# #### Scatter plot

# You can create a scatterplot in Tableau Public, which can be easier to manipulate and present. If you'd like step by step instructions, you can review the following link. Those instructions create a scatterplot showing the relationship between total_amount and trip_distance. Consider adding the Tableau visualization to your executive summary, and adding key insights from your findings on those two variables.

# First, check to whether the drop-off locations IDs are consecutively numbered. For instance, does it go 1, 2, 3, 4..., or are some numbers missing (e.g., 1, 3, 4...). If numbers aren't all consecutive, the histogram will look like some locations have very few or no rides when in reality there's no bar because there's no location.
